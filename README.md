# MyGame
The project I made for my Honors CSIS Project in Fall 2023

Extremely basic dungeon crawler game using C++ and Visual Studio debugger. 
You roam through each area by completing the tasks given. Where you go is random, but there is a barrier against repeating after you've just been there. 

Has an in-game shop, fighting mechanics (healing, damage, battles), leveling mechanics, and inventory mechanics.
There is no goal other than to upgrade your health and damage to make your life easier.

I got 100% on it and haven't expanded it sense, but it was a fun project. 
I hope you enjoy it if you want to play it. The game runs purely on the debugger, so you don't need to run Unity or Unreal.
